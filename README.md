# TinySteps -  simple service for the selection of tutors

You are going to create a site that will have a "database" in the form of JSON files.

When responding to a request, data from the "database" must be read, and when saving user orders, the data must be written to the "database".

1. Describe the routes

2. Copy mock data to JSON file
    - Write a script that from the mock data in data.py will save it to our "database".
    
3. Выведите страницу преподавателя
    - examine the mock data,
    - read instructor data from JSON file,
    - edit the template,
    - check the result,
    - display a sign of employment,
    - make a link to the booking page from the time selection button(form a link like / booking / 215 / monday / 12).
